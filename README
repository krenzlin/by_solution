Aufgabe:

Given a plaintext file containing URLs, one per line, e.g.:
 http://mywebserver.com/images/271947.jpg
 http://mywebserver.com/images/24174.jpg
 http://somewebsrv.com/img/992147.jpg

Write a script that takes this plaintext file as an argument and downloads all images, storing them on the local hard disk. Approach the problem as you would any task in a normal day’s work. Imagine this code will be used in important live systems, modified later on by other developers, and so on.

Please use the Python programming language for your solution. We prefer to receive your code in GitHub or a similar repository.
