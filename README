## Solution to the following exercise

Given a plaintext file containing URLs, one per line, e.g.:
 http://mywebserver.com/images/271947.jpg
 http://mywebserver.com/images/24174.jpg
 http://somewebsrv.com/img/992147.jpg

Write a script that
* takes this plaintext file as an argument
* and downloads all images,
* storing them on the local hard disk.
Approach the problem as you would any task in a normal dayâ€™s work.
Imagine this code will be used in important live systems,
modified later on by other developers, and so on.

Please use the Python programming language for your solution.


## DEPENDENCIES

Needs Python3 (tested on py35)

- click
- requests

For testing
